# BrainPy

This is a brainfuck interpreter implemented in python. This was developed as a fun afternoon project and has not been tested extensively. Any bug reports are more than welcome.

### Getting Started

Simply clone the above project and you will be good to go.
Make sure you have python 3.x installed. Head over to [python website](https://www.python.org) to install latest version of python on your machine.

### Running

Navigate to the directory where you have cloned this project using terminal/ command prompt/ powershell and run following commands

```sh
$ python brainpy.py hello.b
```
this should give the following output 
```sh
> Hello World!
```
If this works then you are all set.
In order to run this on your own brainfuck files, simply replace `hello.b` with your file.

if this doesn't work for you check
* if your terminal /shell is in the same directory as `brainpy.py`
* if you have installed python 3.x and not python 2.x
